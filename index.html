        <p class="about-text">Studio Bergini is a graphic design and communication studio based in East London. We aim to produce work that has a strong conceptual approach, and we are not concerned with the traditional boundaries of graphic design. We are open to working in print, digital, web, film, animation, photography; whatever we think is most appropriate for the individual project.</p>
        <p class="about-text">Studio Bergini was set up by Francesco Corsini & Kristian Hjorth Berge, both graduates from Central Saint Martins in London.</p>
        <p class="about-text">Some clients include: Nablus Soap Company, Pentagram, Nuart Festival, Reed Projects Gallery, Jeffrey Charles Henry Peacock, Street Art London, Howard Griffin Gallery, Lunatics Records, Central Saint Martins College of Arts & Design, Fasett AS.</p>

          <p>Variations I was conceived as a series of chance operations that ultimately led to the creation of a publication realised by Central Saint Martins students in London. Variations I consists of a set of instructions that like musical scores have the potential to be realised by anyone other than the original creator. The instructions involve real and imaginary actions, ideas, and objects from everyday life re-contextualised as performance.</p>
