        <p class="about-text">Studio Bergini is a graphic design and communication studio based in East London. We aim to produce work that has a strong conceptual approach, and we are not concerned with the traditional boundaries of graphic design. We are open to working in print, digital, web, film, animation, photography; whatever we think is most appropriate for the individual project.</p>
        <p class="about-text">Studio Bergini was set up by Francesco Corsini & Kristian Hjorth Berge, both graduates from Central Saint Martins in London.</p>

            <p class="text-left">The CSM BA Fine Art class of 2015 asked us to design their graduation catalog, 2015.<br><br>The initial brief was to make the catalog soft-covered and magazine-sized, with the layout taking the classic minimalist approach of “letting the artworks speak for themselves” and thereby “adding as little design as possible”, while at the same time avoiding the standard format of straight image-blurb-image-blurb. For each of the almost 150 artist/students we had to accompany images of artworks, descriptions, and a blurb. There were also seven commissioned texts and one interview to include. That the catalog be thin and “magazine-like” was an important aspect to the committee. <a class="toggle-text read-more" href="#">(more)</a></p>

            <p class="text-center">Our solution was to develop a grid system with the ability to accommodate all of those different elements, but that would also look good if it were in places to contain only one of the elements, as we anticipated that the contributors would not all be supplying the same kind of content. And due to the sheer volume of content, our system had to be very rational and leave very few variables for us to adjust, so that we wouldn’t have to obsess over details too much. At the same time the system had to have a certain flexibility to it, in order to give the impression of a publication in constant flux.</p>
            <p class="text-right">We ended up splitting the spread in four, so that we could accompany four students on each spread and in turn keep the overall thickness of the publication to a minimum. This created another major challenge towards the end, as we had to rearrange the students and move them between pages to make sure there was a certain amount of balance and no clashing sections.<br><br>Without indicating so, we divided the students into clusters based on the different areas of the degree show exhibition. That way the visitors would avoid having to go back and forth in the catalog to find who they were looking at, but rather go through more or less page-by-page as they moved through the exhibition.</p>

            <p class="text-center">Taking its name from an experimental musical score written by the American composer John Cage in 1958, Variations I aims to turn its readers into active interpreters and participants by enabling them to perform, interpret and play with the instructions in different ways.<br><br>Inspired by Fluxus and conceptual artistic and curatorial practices of the 1960s, this publication could be seen as having a tripartite nature: as an “object” to be played with, a “portable exhibition” consisting of “Open Works”, and as a collection of “Texts” to be performed.</p>
            <p class="text-right">Our role in this collaboration was as art directors, designers, co-curators, and contributors. The publication was risograph printed, french-folded, and bound with a binding clip. These factors all serve the purpose of making a cost-effective, intriguing, tactile object that could be easily disassembled, reassebled, and used.<br><br><a href="http://variations1.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">variations1.tumblr.com</a></p>
