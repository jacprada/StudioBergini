        <p class="about-text">Studio Bergini is a graphic design and communication studio based in East London. We aim to produce work that has a strong conceptual approach, and we are not concerned with the traditional boundaries of graphic design. We are open to working in print, digital, web, film, animation, photography; whatever we think is most appropriate for the individual project.</p>
        <p class="about-text">Studio Bergini was set up by Francesco Corsini & Kristian Hjorth Berge, both graduates from Central Saint Martins in London.</p>

            <p class="text-left">The CSM BA Fine Art class of 2015 asked us to design their graduation catalog.<br><br>The initial brief was to make the catalog soft­covered and magazine­sized, with the layout taking the classic minimalist approach of “letting the artworks speak for themselves” and thereby “adding as little design as possible”, while at the same time avoiding the standard format of straight image­blurb-image­blurb.<br>For each of the almost 150 artist/students we had to accompany images of artworks, descriptions, and a blurb. There were also seven commissioned texts and one interview to include. That the catalog be thin and “magazine­like” was an important aspect to the committee.</p>

            <p class="text-center">Our solution was to develop a grid system with the ability to accommodate all of those different elements, but that would also look good if it were in places to contain only one of the elements, as we anticipated that the contributors would not all be supplying the same kind of content. And due to the sheer volume of content, our system had to be very rational and leave very few variables for us to adjust, so that we wouldn’t have to obsess over details too much. At the same time the system had to have a certain flexibility to it, in order to give the impression of a publication in constant flux.</p>
            <p class="text-right">We ended up splitting the spread in four, so that we could accompany four students on each spread and in turn keep the overall thickness of the publication to a minimum.<br><br>For us, there was no other option but to do a typographic cover. To honour the concept already employed on the inside - of minimalism, white space, and some deviation from the typical degree show catalog, we decided to do a full alphabetical index of all contributing students with their contact details, stretching over the front and back covers.<br><br>Thanks to Phil Baines, our typography professor at the time, for providing invaluable feedback.</p>

Noir wanted to perform one real revolutionary act: to paint the Wall, to transform it, to make it ridiculous, and ultimately to help destroy it.</p>
          <p class="text-right">Noir's iconic, bright and seemingly innocent works painted on this deadly border symbolised a sole act of defiance and a lone voice of freedom. In this landmark exhibition at Howard Griffin Gallery in Shoreditch new original works were exhibited alongside rarely seen photographs, interviews and films, juxtaposing old and new to reassess Noir's enduring legacy and contribution to society.<br><br><a href="http://howardgriffingallery.com/exhibitions/thierry-noir-a-retrospective/" target="_blank">howardgriffingallery.com/exhibitions/thierry-noir-a-retrospective</a></p>
